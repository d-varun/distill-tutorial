## About Me
Hello! My name is **Varun Dommeti**, a Sophomore at Dublin Jerome High School. Some of my interests are programming and music!

## About the Project
My project *Temporary Title*, will relate to music, but I'm not entirely sure exactly what yet!

## Goals
* Display and modify data related to music
* Create a visually pleasing website for viewing musical data
  + Take into account bias by asking others for opinions on website design
